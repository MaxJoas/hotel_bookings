# How Data Science can Make a Hotel More Profitable

This project was created as part of the Udacity Nanodegree.
The objective was to find a dataset and use data Science to give relevant business-related insights.
The analyse aims to answer the following questions:
1. Can we predict whether a customer will cancel his reservation?
2. Which factors are the most important to predict whether a customer will cancel his reservation?\
  2.1 How do these factors correlate with cancellation?
3. Which distribution channels are used by regular customers?

## File Structure
I chose a dataset from Kaggle on Hotel Bookings. The dataset can be found in the data direcotry of this project.
I documented the coding process and results in the analyse_hotel_bookings.ipynb file. Plot creation was extracted to 
plotting_func.py. The tuning parametes for the Random Forest are stored in random_parameters.py

## Medium Article
I summarized the results for a non-technical audience in a medium article.
