### Project Motivation

This project was created as part of the Udacity Nanodegree.
The objective was to find a dataset and use data Science to give relevant business-related insights.
In this case I used hotel booking and identified the following questions:

The analyse aims to answer the following questions:
1. Can we predict whether a customer will cancel his reservation?
2. Which factors are the most important to predict whether a customer will cancel his reservation?\
  2.1 How do these factors correlate with cancellation?
3. Which distribution channels are used by regular customers?

### Requirements
The following libraries have been used:
*  Python 3.6.9
*  Pandas 1.1.2
*  Numpy 1.19.2
*  Matplotlib 3.3.3
*  Seaborn 0.11.0 

### File Structure
*  `analyse_hotel_bookings.ipynb:` Main Notebook, contains code for the analysis and documentation
*  `plotting_func.py:` contains two functions for visualization
*  `random_parameters.py:` contains the parameters for the Random Forest hyperparameter tuning
*  `hotel_bookings.csv:` data file

### Medium Article
I summarized the results for a non-technical audience in a medium article.

The data for the project is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand) and was prepared by Jesse Mostipak.
The data is originally from the article [Hotel Booking Demand Datasets](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340918315191), written by Nuno Antonio, Ana Almeida, and Luis Nunes for Data in Brief, Volume 22, February 2019. The data was downloaded and cleaned by Thomas Mock and Antoine Bichat for #TidyTuesday during the week of February 11th, 2020.
